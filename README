#### Graphics Engine ####

Graphics Engine is a small projected aimed for Vulkan learning purposes.

Current status:
- Vulkan backend is almost ready
- support for resources like: buffers, textures, framebuffers, rendertarget, simple material, shaders
- there is no scene culling yet, the the scene code is there (bare minimum)
- no support for object transforms yet

- triangle example application

End goal:
A small graphics engine that supports these features:
- graphics API/backends: Vulkan, OpenGL, OpenGLES, Direct3D 11.
- scene construction
- scene based culling
- decent material support
- effects: simple lighting, shadows, fog, post-processing
- UI support
= simple physics support
- own math library support (maybe)
- have several test/example applications
- platforms: Desktop, Mobile via Win32, WInRT, UWP, Linux, MacOS, Android
